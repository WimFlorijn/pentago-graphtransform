\label{Introduction}
Currently we are taking part in the Software Science course. In the Software Science course, a graph transformation tool called GROOVE is discussed. The course involves understanding the logic behind the graph transformation technique, and working with the tool itself. We have plenty of experience with modelling problems in GROOVE, and will discuss a more elaborate problem as subject of the course project. We have chosen to model a board game called Pentago. In this proposal we will discuss the structure and the rules of this game, possible extensions and how we plan to approach the modelling.
