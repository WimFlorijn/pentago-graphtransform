\label{Introduction}
Currently we are taking part in the Software Science course. In this course, a graph transformation tool called GROOVE is discussed. The course involves understanding the logic behind the graph transformation technique, and learning to work with the tool itself. At the moment we have plenty of experience with modelling problems in GROOVE, and will discuss a more elaborate problem as subject of the course project. We have chosen to model a board game called Pentago. In this report we discuss the game, possible extensions and our approach to the modelling. We will also discuss the design choices we have made.
