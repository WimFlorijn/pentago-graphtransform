\section{Strategy}
\label{Strategy}
When the game is executed as how it is defined in chapter \ref{Design}, players place marbles and rotate sub-boards randomly.
In this section, we describe how smart strategies can be implemented in GROOVE, and we evaluate a smart strategy of our own.

\subsection{Smart block placement}

\subsubsection{Graph}
Tell something about the flag

\subsubsection{Rules}
Tell about the specific rules

\subsubsection{Control Program}
Tell about the control program's function

\subsection{Results}
To be able to draw a conclusion about whether our strategy performs well, we want to formally evaulate its performance.
Because the game is relatively complex, it is impossible to generate the entire state space of the game, and determine the complete win rate of the naive and the smart strategies.
Therefore we have decided to perform a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values.

TODO

To determine the number of iterations needed to meet these requirements, we use the following formula \cite{sim-modeling}:

%n = (zα/2 S / E ) ²
