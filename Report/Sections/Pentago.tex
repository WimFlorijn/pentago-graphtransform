Pentago is a two-player game invented by Tomas Flodén. 
The game is played on a 6×6 board divided into four 3×3 sub-boards (also called quadrants). 
Taking turns, the two players place a marble of their color onto an unoccupied space on the board, and then rotate one of the sub-boards by 90 degrees either clockwise or counter-clockwise. 
A player wins by getting five of its marbles in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row. 
In figure \ref{fig:boardpic} player white wins by posessing a diagonal row. 
If all 36 spaces on the board are occupied without a row of five having formed then the game is a draw.
If multiple players achieve a row of five simultaneously, the game is a draw.
Also a multi-player version for 3 or 4 players has been developed and features a 9×9 board. 
This addition is called super-pentago. 
We plan to model pentago in a scalable fashion so that the board and player size can be defined on initialization.
